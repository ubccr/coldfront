    This class is used to register plugin content to be injected into core ColdFront templates. It contains methods
    that are overridden by plugin authors to return template content.

    The `models` attribute on the class defines the which specific model detail pages this class renders content
    for. It should be defined as a list of strings in the following form:

        models = ['<app_label>.<model_name>', '<app_label>.<model_name>']

    If `models` is left as None, the extension will render for _all_ models.

    The `render()` method provides the following context data:

    * object - The object being viewed (object views only)
    * model - The type of object being viewed (list views only)
    * request - The current request
    * settings - Global ColdFront settings
    * config - Plugin-specific configuration parameters
