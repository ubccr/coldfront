Dear {{center_name}} user,

Your access to {{center_name}} resources has expired. Any accounts under these allocation(s) are now unable to
access the associated resource. If you wish to continue using them, the group owners responsible for the following project(s) must create a new
allocation request(s). Below is a list of links to your project(s) containing at least one expired allocation: 
{% for project_key, project_url in project_dict.items %}
Project Title: {{project_key}}
Project URL: {{ project_url.0 }}
Project PI: {{ project_url.1 }} 

    {% spaceless %} {% for allocation_key, allocation_value in allocation_dict.items %}{% if allocation_key == project_url.0 %}Expired Allocation(s):{% for allocation in allocation_value %}{% for allocation_url, resource_name in allocation.items %}
        {{ resource_name }}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}
{% endfor %}
The group owner responsible for this project is required to renew it on a yearly basis. If you have not done so in the
last year, you will be required to before requesting a new allocation.
For more information about the yearly renewal, visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url }}.

If you are a student or collaborator under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy. If you would like
to opt out of future notifications, instructions can be found here: {{ opt_out_instruction_url }}

Thank you,
