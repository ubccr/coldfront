Dear {{center_name}} PI,

Your access to {{center_name}} resources are expiring soon. Failure to renew the expiring resources(s) on time will terminate access to the resource 
for all users on the allocation. Below is a list of links to your project(s) containing at least one expiring resource:
{% for resources_key, resources_value in resources.items %} 
Resource Name: {{ resources_key.0 }}
Resource URL: {{ resources_key.1 }}
{% for days in expiry_days %} {% for resource in resources_value %} {% if days == resource.1 %}
    {{ resource.0 }} is expiring in {{days}} days
       {% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}

Thank you,
