Dear {{center_name}} user,

Your access to {{center_name}}'s resources is expiring soon. Failure to renew the expiring allocation(s) on time will terminate access to the resource 
for all users on the allocation. To renew, login to ColdFront and complete the short renewal process for each expiring allocation.  Below is a list of links to 
your project(s) containing at least one expiring allocation: 
{% for project_key, project_url in project_dict.items %}
Project Title: {{project_key}}
Project URL: {{ project_url.0 }}
Project PI: {{ project_url.1 }}

    {% spaceless %}{% for days_key, days_value in expiration_dict.items %}
    Allocation(s) expiring in {{days_key}} days:{% for allocations in days_value %}{% if allocations.0 == project_url.0 %}  
        {% spaceless %}{{ allocations.2 }}{% endspaceless %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}
{% endfor %}
The group owner responsible for this project is required to renew it on a yearly basis. If you have not done so in the
last year, you will be required to before renewing the allocation.
For more information about the yearly renewal, visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url }}

If you are a student or collaborator under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy. If you would like
