        level given for the new org level must be less than that of the parent.
        For this case, this script is not really needed.

        If a parent org level is given and the parent has a child org level,
        then the given level must be between the parent and child levels,
        and the new org level will be added in between those two in the
        hierarchy.  For each Organization found at the child org level, we will
        create a placeholder Organization at the newly inserted OrgLevel
        and set the new Organization's parent to that of the Organization at
        the child OrgLevel, and sets that Organization's parent to the newly
        inserted Organization.

        For most cases this method will temporarily disable the validation
        checks (which would otherwise prevent the addition of the org level).

        Given an Project and a list of Organizations, update 
        the Organizations associated with the Project.

        The elements of organization_list can be:
            a dict with keys 'organization' and 'is_primary'
                The value for the organization key can be an instance
                of Organization or the fullcode of an Organization
            an Organization instance
            the fullcode of an Organization.
        If the Organization was provided as instance or fullcode, or
        as a dictionary w/out the 'is_primary' key, is_primary will
        default as follows:
            if default_primary is set AND it is the first element
                of the list, default to True
            if Org is already associated with the Project, then we
                do not change its primariness unless explicitly
                instructed to do so; i.e. is_primary defaults to
                the current is_primary setting for the association
                (which can change as we loop through the list)
            otherwise, defaults to False
        default to False *unless* default_first_primary is set AND

        If is_primary is set, any previously primary Organization for
        the Project (including if it was previously set by an earlier
        entry in this object list) is demoted to secondary and the
        current Organization is made primary.

        If delete is False (the default), the Organizations in
        organization_list are added to the set of Organizations for
        the Project, and any previously existing Organizations for the
        project are left alone (with the exception that a primary Organization
        might be demoted to secondary if we added a new primary).
        If delete is True, any previously existing Organizations for the
        Project not included in the organization_list will be disassociated
        with the Project; i.e. the resulting set of Organizations will match
        organization_list.

        Returns a dictionary indicating changes made; keys are of the
        form 'Org[fcode]' where fcode is the fullcode of the Organization
        that was updated, and value is a dictionary with keys 'old' and 'new'.
        The old and new keys can have the following values:
            None: not present.  I.e., if in old it means the org was newly
                associated with the project, in new it means was disassociated.
