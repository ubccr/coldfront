# Slurm integration for ColdFront

ColdFront django plugin providing Slurm integration for ColdFront.
Allocations in ColdFront are marshalled out to Slurm associations in the
Slurm flat file format and can be loaded with sacctmgr. For more information on
the Slurm flat file format see [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacctmgr.html).

The "slurm\_check" command line tool is also provided with this app 
and allows an administrator to check the consistency between ColdFront and 
Slurm and optionally remove any associations that should not be in Slurm 
according to ColdFront.

The "slurm\_sync" command line tool allows for synchronizing the Slurm
configuration (provided via Slurm flat file format) with the ColdFront
database with fine-grained control.  It normally executes (or lists if
run in "noop" mode) the Slurm sacctmgr commands needed to bring the
Slurm configuration in agreement with ColdFront.  Flags can be provided
to control which actions to issue (e.g. can skip creating and/or deleting
users, accounts, etc) or which account/user settings to ignore.

## Design

Resources in ColdFront map to Clusters (or partitions within a cluster) in
Slurm. The name of the Slurm cluster is taken from a resource attribute in
ColdFront named "slurm\_cluster".  You can optionally provide Slurm
specifications for a cluster using a resource attribute named "slurm\_specs".
The value of this attribute must conform to the Slurm specification format and
are colon separated.

Allocations in ColdFront map to Accounts in Slurm. The name of the Slurm
account is taken from a allocation attribute in ColdFront named
"slurm\_account\_name" . You can optionally provide Slurm specifications for
the account using a allocation attribute named "slurm\_specs". The value of
this attribute must conform to the Slurm specification format and are colon
separated.

Allocation users in ColdFront map to Users in Slurm. You can optionally
provide Slurm specifications for each user in a allocation using a
allocation attribute named "slurm\_user\_specs". The value of this attribute
must conform to the Slurm specification format and are colon separated. Setting
specifications on an individual user basis is not currently supported.

## Usage

To enable this plugin set the following environment variables:

```
PLUGIN_SLURM=True
SLURM_SACCTMGR_PATH='/usr/bin/sacctmgr' 
```

To generate Slurm association data from ColdFront run the following command:

```
    $ coldfront slurm_dump -o /output_dir
```

You can then load this file into Slurm with the following command:

```
    $ sacctmgr load file=/output_dir/tux.cfg

```

## Special cases

Resources in ColdFront can optionally be organized into parent/child
relationships. This is useful in the context of Slurm for example if you have a
single Slurm controller with multiple partitions. Each partition represents a
separate resource in ColdFront that users can subscribe to. In this case you
would create a parent resource that represents your Slurm cluster (or
controller) with a resource type of "Cluster". Each Slurm partition would be a
separate resource in ColdFront with a resource type of "Partition" and have
their parent resource set to the Slurm cluster. Users wouldn't subscribe to the
parent Slurm cluster resource but only subscribe to the partition resources. Here
you would only set the "slurm\_cluster" resource attribute on the Slurm cluster
resource and not on the partitions. Also, "slurm\_specs" resource attribute on
partitions are merged with the allocation "slurm\_specs" and set on the Slurm
account association instead of the cluster.

## CLI Usage

To check the consistency between ColdFront and Slurm run the following command:

```
    $ sacctmgr dump file=/output_dir/tux.cfg
    $ coldfront slurm_check -i /output_dir/tux.cfg
```

This will process the output of sacctmgr dump flat file and compare to active
allocations in ColdFront. Any users with Slurm associations that are not
members of an active Allocation in ColdFront will be reported and can be
removed. You can optionally provide the '--sync' flag and this tool will remove
associations in Slurm using sacctmgr.
