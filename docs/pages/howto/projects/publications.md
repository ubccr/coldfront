## Publication Information

Publications can be added to a project by the PI or manager.  Publications can be uploaded using a DOI number or they can be entered in manually.  PIs and managers can remove publications they no longer wish to have on their project and export the full list or a selection of the publications to a CSV file.  Center directors and system administrators are able to access the list of all publications added in ColdFront.  The Center Summary contains summary information about the publications and is available to logged in as well as non-authenticated users.
